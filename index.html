            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is an integral procedure designed to collect previous versions of a file or application in an efficient, well-organized way. 
            Whenever working on a particular project, it is important to retain previous versions of the project so that if for any reason one needs to go back to a previous version; the option is available.
            For instance, if Facebook published their Facebook1.0 version and then updated to Facebook1.1, it would be beneficial to the company to be able to fall back to the 1.0 version should any bugs or crashes arise from the 1.1 version.
            This process of Version Control is provided by multiple services; one such being Github.com.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is a mechanism designed to store and retain information and/or data.
            A local repository is typically stored on your computer before it is sent to a remote repositiory.
            In my case, for this assignment, my remote repository is located in a Github server, miles away from me.
            When I edit files on my computer and save them, the information I created is stored in the local repository.
            Whenever I am ready to push the files to the remote repository, there are a few steps invlolved in doing so.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is a version control repository on the web. It is currently the most popular website used for version control with companies like Facebook and Google using the service.
            With Github, one is able to push and pull files to and from the remote repository at Github.
            Github utilizes git commands, of course, in order to push and pull said files or applications to and from its remote repository(ies).
            Github is an open source project, meaning that contributors around the world collaborated in creating Github.
            The site is free to use, but also has premium features should the user want a more enhanced experience.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Pushing and Pulling</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Pushing and Pulling refers to the procedure where the user sends files or applications to a remote repository and receives files or applications from a remote repository.
            Whenever an application or file is completed, the user can 'push' the project to a remote repository; in my case, I will be pushing this particular file to Github.
            If I need to receive a previous version of this file for whatever reason, I can 'pull' a past version of this file from the remote repository Github thanks to version control.
            There are multiple steps that need to be accomplished before files are ready to be pushed or pulled.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are multiple git commands designed to help push and pull your files to remote and local repositories.
            'git init' allows the computer to initialize a repository to store your information.
            'git add' adds file changes to your index from the directory.
            'git commit' saves all changes done to the index and prepares the files for a push to the repository.
            'git config' configures your personal username and email to work with whatever files you are working on.
            There are many other git commands available to accomplish specific tasks, but the above commands are very common.</p>
